                                        <p>The current generation of Web applications (Web 2.0) have made them an outright phenomenon in today’s society helping to redefine the way organisations and individuals communicate and collaborate with each other. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise the evolution of Web technologies from a user perspective. Based on inference from existing studies, this paper attempts to identify the architectural direction that the next generation (Web 3.0) of Web applications would meld itself into. The paper emphasizes limitations of current Web technologies and how future trends may address these limitations by focusing on migration that has been witnessed in the scope of the applications presented and features delivered on the Web from a users’ perspective..</p>

                                        <p data-skm-boomerang-el-1="processed">React 18, a major upgrade to the popular JavaScript library, is now available as a production release, highlighted by a new concurrent renderer and automatic batching of updates.

Concurrent rendering, or “Concurrent React,” allows React to prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This behind-the-scenes capability serves as the basis for many new features in React 18. Concurrent React is opt-in, only enabled when concurrent features are in use..</p>
